Vision Transformer-Based Hand Gesture Recognition with HD-sEMG Signals

* This is the code for a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** that is designed for gesture recognition with 3D High-Desnity sEMG (HD-sEMG) signals. 
* The code is written in **PyTorch**.
* For detailed explanation please refer to one of the following papers:
